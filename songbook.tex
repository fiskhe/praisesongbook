    \beginverse
    Am\[C]azing Grace, how sw\[F]eet the s\[C]ound,
    That s\[C]aved a wretch like m\[G]e.

    Was bl\[Am]ind, but n\[G]ow I s\[C]ee.
    \endverse

    \beginverse

    my heart to fear.
    And grace, my fears relieved.
    How precious did that grace appear,
    the hour I first believed.
    \endverse

    \beginverse
    Through many dangers, toils and snares,
    I have already come. 
    'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
    and grace will lead us home.
    \endverse

    \beginverse
    The Lord has promised good to me,
    His word my hope secures.
    He will my shield and portion be,
    as long as life endures.
    \endverse

    \beginverse
    When we've been there ten thousand years,
    bright shining as the sun.
    We've no less days to sing God's praise,
    than when we first begun.
